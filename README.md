# MathGPT Extension

A Chrome extension that provides a floating overlay for mathematical assistance. Built with Plasmo and React, the extension renders a draggable tooltip widget that persists across browser sessions and can be positioned anywhere on the page. The overlay features a glass-morphism design with smooth animations and supports minimize/expand functionality.
